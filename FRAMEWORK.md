## Define business objectives
*Why are you gamifying? How do you hope to benefit your business, or achieve some other goal such as motivating people to change their behavior? As you state your objectives, emphasize the end goal or goals of your gamified design rather than detailing the means through which you'll achieve this goal. Basically, if your gamified system does what you intend, what specific positive results will it generate for your organization?*

1. Increase participation in viewing, contributions, discussion pages, and reviewing wiki content
   1. 100% for those in CX3 by _____ date
   1. Increase by those outside CX3 - 20 more active users from EC/XX/MER/OneEVA by _____ date
1. Improve validity of data in wiki (how can we quantify how much we trust data in the wiki?)
1. Increase user awareness of why their contributions are important (revisions, discussion, pending reviews). This isn’t a direct benefit to the group or to the wiki, but this will indirectly support the wiki through intrinsic motivation -- giving our users more reasons to spend their time contributing.

## Delineate target behaviors
*What do you want your players to do? And what are the metrics that will allow you to measure them? These behaviors should promote your business objectives, although the relationship may be indirect. For example, your business goal might be to increase sales, but your target behavior could be for visitors to spend more time on your website. As you describe the behaviors, be sure to explain how they will help your system achieve its objectives. The metrics should in some fashion provide feedback to the players, letting them know when they are successfully engaging in the intended behaviors.*

1. General Usership
   1. Increase wiki page views in general (Wiretap)
      1. 100% of CX3 views wiki x times in y days by z date

   1. Increase contributions in general (Watch Analytics?, Contribution Score, new extension?)
      1. 100% of CX3 contributes (edit, new page, etc) x times in y days by z date
   1. Increase discussion page usage (Watch Analytics?, Contribution Score, new extension?)
      1. 100% of CX3 contributes to discussion pages x times in y days by z date
      1. 20 more active users from EC/XX/MER/OneEVA contribute to discussion pages x times in y days by z date
   1. Increase use of Meeting Minutes (Meeting Minutes)
      1. 100% of CX3 creates Meeting Minutes x times by z date
   1. Increase use of Related article (Meeting Minutes)
      1. x% of Meeting Minutes topics have at least one valid Related article by z date
1. Validity of Data
   1. Document SMEs (CX3 custom)
      1. 100% of ORU/Tool/EMU Component/Generic Hardware pages have SME assigned by z date
   1. Document CX3 personnel qualifications (CX3 custom)
      1. 100% population of user page info (certs, cadres, EVAs and missions worked) by z date
   1. Increase page watching (Watch Analytics)
      1. Increase number of CX3 watchers of every page to at least 2 by z date
      1. Increase number of EC/XX/MER/OneEVA watchers of relevant hardware pages to at least 2 by z date
   1. Improve page review cycle (Watch Analytics - Pending Reviews)
      1. Reduce average number of pending watches for every CX3 user to x by z date
      1. Reduce max pending time for every CX3 user to x by z date
      1. Reduce average pending time for every CX3 user to x by z date 
      1. Every page is viewed (and thus briefly reviewed) every x days (by CX3)
      1. Increase pages marked “Update after” by CX3 people
      1. Pages marked “Update after” are reviewed by x CX3 people
      1. Phase 2 should extend these target behaviors to EC/XX/MER/OneEVA
   1. Increase citations of references (Cite, Citoid?, new extension?)
      1. Every “factoid” should either have “citation needed” or a citation
      1. Opinions should be noted as such using Template:Opinion
1. Demonstrate Value
   1. Thank/acknowledge others’ contributions (Watch Analytics?, Echo?)
      1. 100% of CX3 recognizes another CX3 user’s contribution that benefitted them x times by z date
      1. 100% of CX3 recognizes contribution by EC/XX/MER/OneEVA that benefitted them x times by z date
   1. Acknowledge when a page answered a question (New extension)
      1. 100% of CX3 clicks a button to acknowledge when a wiki page has answered a question they were looking up x times by z date

## Describe your players
*Who are the people who will be participating in your gamified activity? What is their relationship to you? For example, are they prospective customers, employees at your organization, or some other community? And what are they like? You can describe your players using demographics (such as age and gender), psychographics (such as their values and personalities), Bartle’s player types, or some other framework. You should show that you understand what sorts of game elements and other structures are likely to be effective for this population. For example, you might discuss whether a more competitive or cooperative system would be better for this player community.*

## Devise your activity loops
*Explore in greater detail how you will motivate your players using engagement and progression loops. First, describe the kinds of feedback your system will offer the players to encourage further action, and explain how this feedback will work to motivate the players. (Remember: rewards are only one kind of feedback.) Second, how if at all will players progress in your system? This includes how the system will get new players engaged, and how it will remain interesting for more experienced players.*

## Don't forget the fun
*Although more abstract than some of the other elements, ensuring that your gamified system is fun remains as important as the other aspects. In order to fully explore this aspect of the design process, consider how your game would function without any extrinsic rewards. Would you say it was fun? Identify which aspects of the game could continue to motivate players to participate even without rewards.*

## Deploy the appropriate tools
*By this point, you've probably identified several of the game elements and other specifics of your gamified system. If you haven’t already, you should explain in detail what your system would look like. What are some of the game elements involved and what will the experience be like for the players? What specific choices would you make in deploying your system? For example, you might discuss whether the gamified system is to be experienced primarily on personal computers, mobile devices, or some other platform. You might also describe what feedback, rewards, and other reinforcements the players could receive. Finally, think about whether you’ve tied your decisions back to the other five steps in the process, especially the business objectives.*
